Problem 1:

1a. An association list is a data structure used to record 
short, mappings of keys to values. It consists of a list 
of pairs, with each pair representing an association 
between the key (car, or the first element) and the datum 
(cdr, the tail end). 
    Ex. ((pine . cones)
         (oak . acorns)
         (maple . seeds))
