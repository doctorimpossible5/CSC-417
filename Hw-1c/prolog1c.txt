Problem 1:

1a. An association list is a data structure used to record 
short, mappings of keys to values. It consists of a list 
of pairs, with each pair representing an association 
between the key (car, or the first element) and the datum 
(cdr, the tail end). 
    Ex. ((pine . cones)
         (oak . acorns)
         (maple . seeds))

1b. The assoc function searches an association and returns
the first car and cdr pair of elements which satisfy the 
test argument. 

    In this section of code, it will run through the list
    and return the pair with r as the car. In this case it
    will return (r . x)
    
1c. The mapcan function takes each element of the provided
list and applies the provided function. 

    This function has a variety of uses, such as finding all
    the positive numbers in a list. This would be done with
    the following: 
    (mapcan (lambda (x) (if (> x 0) (list x) nil)) '(8 7 6
    -5 -4 3 -2 1))
